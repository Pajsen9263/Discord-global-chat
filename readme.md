# Discord Global chat

## Introduction

A simple node.js bot to send message on multiple server in the same channel.

## Needs

You need to install Node.js and have a discord bot token on this page : https://discord.com/developers/applications

## Installation

Once you download the files and install node.js, make 'npm install' in the project folder. Then, go to the main.js file and add the asked informations on line 5 and 6
```javascript
{
var prefix = ("!");
bot.login("Put your token here");
}
```
When you run the bot, create "global" channel on the server where the bot is then send a message in that channel to send it to all the servers.
